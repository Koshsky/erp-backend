-- ARCHIVE-BASED SOFT DELETE
-- =============================================
-- Soft delete is implemented by moving the row: BEFORE DELETE inserts the
-- row into the per-table <table>_deleted archive (V1) and the DELETE then
-- really removes it from the live table. The live tables hold active rows
-- only, so no deleted_at column, no cascade-soft-delete UPDATE triggers and
-- no hard-DELETE blocks are needed — FK ON DELETE CASCADE deletes the whole
-- subtree and every child archives itself through its own trigger.
--
-- Tables WITHOUT deleted_at (user_states, resource_members, refresh_sessions,
-- idempotency_keys, project_auto_create) stay hard-deleted as before.
